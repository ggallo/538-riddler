We're bowling with perfect spheres of radius 1 inch, with two bowls already positioned with their centers exactly 5 inches apart. We want to bowl in a straight line so that the angle between the roll and the line between the existing bowls is minimzed, and our ball will not touch the other two. Solve!"

    "First the answer, then an attempt at animation. To rephrase the setup, W.L.O.G., we have bowls $A$ and $B$ each of radius 1 inch, with origins 5 inches apart, and we want our bowl $P$ travelling along line $\\ell$ to form as small an angle $\\phi$ as possible with $\\overline{AB}$. Call the point where $\\ell$ and $\\overline{AB}$ meet $O$. Solve for $\\phi$.\n",

A bowl $P$ of radius 1 travelling the length of $R$ must also move tangent to the existing bowls because it has the same width as $R$, and thus move as close as possible to $A$ and $B$ without disturbing them. This means $\\ell$ bisects $R$.\n",

    "Now imagine $P$ in motion down the length of this rectangle, and stop it at the moment it is tangent to $A$. By the definition of tangent lines, the line $\\overline{AP}$ forms a right angle with $\\ell$, and we have $\\unicode{0x22BF}APO$, with $\\phi=\\measuredangle POA$. We know from the radii of the bowls that $\\overline{AP}=2$, and (I know I'm reaching here but I'm quite sure it's true due to some argument from roatational symmetry) since $\\ell$ bisects $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{AO}=2.5$.
