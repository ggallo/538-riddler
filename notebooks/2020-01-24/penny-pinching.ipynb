After you get the base cases, it becomes apparent that players need to avoid a move that makes the difference between two piles the same as any lower winning configuration. E.g. if I move to make the piles (15, 18), you can move to (3, 5) and win. Then there's another, more subtle winning rule: you can't move to a state where only one pile shares a value with a winning combo.\n",

No good, because it contains a pile of 2, which is already part of a winning pile. Thus we have (3, 5).
